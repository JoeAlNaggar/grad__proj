# API Integration Authentication Fixes

## Problem
All API calls were returning **401 Unauthorized** errors because the authentication token was not being included in the request headers.

## Root Cause
The `app/services/api.ts` file was using basic axios without any authentication headers, while the application had an existing authentication system in `app/lib/auth.ts` that managed tokens in localStorage.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated API Service (`app/services/api.ts`)
- **Created axios instance** with proper base configuration
- **Added request interceptor** to automatically include authentication token from localStorage
- **Added response interceptor** to handle 401 errors and redirect to login
- **Enhanced error handling** with detailed logging
- **Updated TypeScript interfaces** to match the backend API structure

### 2. Key Changes Made:

#### Authentication Token Handling:
```typescript
// Add request interceptor to include auth token
api.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? localStorage.getItem('auth_token') : null;
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Token ${token}`;
      console.log('✅ API Request: Token included in headers');
    } else {
      console.warn('⚠️ API Request: No token found in localStorage');
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);
```

#### 401 Error Handling:
```typescript
// Add response interceptor to handle 401 errors
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Token is invalid, clear it and redirect to login
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
        localStorage.removeItem('user_data');
        window.location.href = '/login';
      }
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### 3. Updated Community Page (`app/(main)/community/page.tsx`)
- **Added authentication checks** using the existing AuthContext
- **Improved error handling** for authentication failures
- **Added loading states** during authentication verification
- **Auto-redirect to login** if user is not authenticated

### 4. Updated Card Component (`app/(main)/community/components/card.tsx`)
- **Updated interfaces** to match new API response structure
- **Enhanced reaction system** with optimistic updates
- **Improved error handling** for all interactions
- **Better TypeScript type safety**

### 5. Updated Create Post Page (`app/(main)/create/page.tsx`)
- **Complete rewrite** to use the new API service
- **Proper form validation** and error handling
- **Integration with authentication** system
- **Modern UI with loading states**

## Authentication Flow
1. User logs in through existing auth system
2. Token is stored in localStorage as 'auth_token'
3. API service automatically includes token in all requests
4. If token is invalid/expired, user is redirected to login
5. All API calls now work with proper authentication

## Testing the Fix
1. **Check browser console** for authentication logs:
   - ✅ "API Request: Token included in headers" - Token found
   - ⚠️ "API Request: No token found in localStorage" - Not authenticated
2. **Verify API calls** work without 401 errors
3. **Test authentication flow** by logging out and back in

## Files Modified
- `app/services/api.ts` - Complete rewrite with authentication
- `app/(main)/community/page.tsx` - Added auth checks
- `app/(main)/community/components/card.tsx` - Updated for new API
- `app/(main)/create/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite

## Result
✅ **All API calls now include proper authentication headers**
✅ **401 errors are automatically handled with redirects**
✅ **Enhanced error handling and user feedback**
✅ **Seamless integration with existing auth system**
✅ **Better TypeScript type safety**
